## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

dat <- read_csv("cancer patient data sets 2.csv")

library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)

data <- read_csv("cancer patient data sets 2.csv")

names(data) <- make.names(names(data))

names(data)

data$Level <- factor(data$Level,
                     levels = c("Low","Medium","High"),
                     ordered = TRUE)

m1 <- lm(Level ~ Age + Gender + Air.Pollution + Alcohol.use + Dust.Allergy + OccuPational.Hazards + Genetic.Risk + chronic.Lung.Disease + Balanced.Diet + Obesity + Smoking + Passive.Smoker + Chest.Pain + Coughing.of.Blood + Fatigue + Weight.Loss + Shortness.of.Breath + Wheezing + Swallowing.Difficulty + Clubbing.of.Finger.Nails + Frequent.Cold + Dry.Cough + Snoring, data = data)


print(m1)


ggplot(data = dat, mapping = aes(x = Level)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("cancer patient data sets 2.csv")

m1 <- polr(Level ~ Age + Gender + Air Pollution + Alcohol use + Dust Allergy + OccuPational Hazards + Genetic Risk + chronic Lung Disease + Balanced Diet + Obesity + Smoking + Passive Smoker + Chest Pain + Coughing of Blood + Fatigue + Weight Loss + Shortness of Breath + Wheezing + Swallowing Difficulty + Clubbing of Finger Nails + Frequent Cold + Dry Cough + Snoring, data = data)

summary(m1)

m1 <- polr(Level ~ Age + Gender + "Air Pollution" + "Alcohol use" + "Dust Allergy" + 
             "OccuPational Hazards" + "Genetic Risk" + "chronic Lung Disease" + 
             "Balanced Diet" + Obesity + Smoking + "Passive Smoker" + 
             "Chest Pain" + "Coughing of Blood" + Fatigue + "Weight Loss" + 
             "Shortness of Breath" + Wheezing + "Swallowing Difficulty" + 
             "Clubbing of Finger Nails" + "Frequent Cold" + "Dry Cough" + Snoring, data = dat)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
